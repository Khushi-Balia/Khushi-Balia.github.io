Hello!
I am a sophomore pursuing Computer engineering at VJTI, Mumbai. I am currently working under the BeagleBoard.org for the Google summer of code 2023 for the project: `BUILDING AN LLVM BACKEND FOR PRU`. My areas of interest are Compiler development, Computer Vision and ML.
I am a quick and an avid learner eager to explore new domains!
